# Clinical Dataset on Malaria, Dengue, Yellow Fever, and others vector-borne diseases

## Description
This dataset gathers clinical information about patients diagnosed with malaria, dengue, yellow fever, and typhoid fever, as well as patients excluded from these diseases. The data was collected from the health districts of DO and DAFRA, located in the Hauts-Bassins region of Burkina Faso. The dataset includes **300 records**, with 150 consultations from DAFRA and 150 from DO.

The data was preprocessed, and sensitive information such as names, surnames, or places of birth was removed. The original form contained 115 questions, but only **109 questions were retained**. The dataset includes two files:
- **`data.csv`**: contains the clinical data.
- **`description.xls`**: contains the description of the attributes.

Some attributes are present in the description but are missing in the data due to insufficient information.

## Steps to Reproduce
To collect the data, authorization was obtained from the Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso. The data collection was carried out using a **Kobotoolbox form**, provided to the doctors. 

- **For the DO district**: The form was filled in real-time during consultations.
- **For the DAFRA district**: Data was collected from archives.

Initially, the form was printed on paper because the doctors found this method faster due to the large number of patients to be consulted. For data from the DAFRA district, recording was done in two steps:
1. During the first consultation.
2. Upon the availability of laboratory results.

The data collection lasted for **three months**, from **September to November 2024**.
